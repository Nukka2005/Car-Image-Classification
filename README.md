# Car Image Classification

## Project Overview

This assignment implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification and experiments with data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization. The notebook walks through data loading, preprocessing, augmentation pipelines, model definition, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Goals

* Build and train a CNN to classify images from the provided dataset.
* Apply common data augmentation methods (rotation, flips, shifts, zoom, brightness, etc.) and compare performance with/without augmentation.
* Visualize training history (accuracy & loss) and sample predictions.

# Dataset from kaggle

## Environment & Requirements

Recommended Python environment (tested with Python 3.8+):

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `scikit-learn`
* `tensorflow` or `keras` (specify the one used in the notebook)
* `torch` / `torchvision` — only if the notebook uses PyTorch (adjust accordingly)

## Notebook Structure (High-level)

1. **Imports & Setup** — imports, seed-setting, GPU detection
2. **Load Dataset** — reading images, building `tf.data` or `ImageDataGenerator` pipelines (or PyTorch `DataLoader`)
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** — class distribution, sample images
4. **Preprocessing** — resizing, normalization, label encoding
5. **Data Augmentation** — definitions of augmentation transforms and examples
6. **Model Definition** — CNN architecture (convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, final dense layers)
7. **Compilation & Callbacks** — optimizer, loss, metrics, checkpoints, early stopping, learning rate scheduler
8. **Training** — fit the model with and without augmentation, save training history
9. **Evaluation** — confusion matrix, classification report, sample predictions
10. **Conclusion & Next Steps** — summary of findings and ideas for improvement

## Example Model (summary)

A simple CNN used in the notebook may include:

* Input: 128x128 RGB images
* Conv2D(32) -> ReLU -> MaxPool
* Conv2D(64) -> ReLU -> MaxPool
* Conv2D(128) -> ReLU -> MaxPool
* Flatten -> Dense(128) -> Dropout -> Dense(num\_classes, softmax)

Adjust filter counts, kernel sizes, and regularization as required by dataset complexity.

## Data Augmentation Techniques Used

* Random rotation
* Horizontal/vertical flips
* Width/height shift
* Random zoom
* Brightness and contrast jitter

Compare test/validation performance to evaluate augmentation benefit.

4. Update dataset paths and kernel (if necessary), then run cells sequentially. Save trained model weights where indicated.

## Reproducibility Tips

* Set a random seed for numpy, tensorflow/torch, and Python's `random` module.
* Use deterministic flags where available (note: full determinism on GPU may reduce speed).
* Save model weights and training history to reproduce plots and metrics.

## Results & Expected Outputs

* Training & validation accuracy/loss plots
* Confusion matrix and per-class precision/recall
* A saved model (`model.h5` or `checkpoint.pt`) and a `history.pkl`/`history.json` for plotting

## Possible Improvements

* Use transfer learning (ResNet, EfficientNet) for better baseline performance
* Fine-tune augmentation parameters or use `Albumentations` for richer augmentations
* Implement cross-validation for robust performance estimates
* Hyperparameter search (learning rate, batch size, optimizers)
